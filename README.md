Digital System Project

Description:

This project aims to design and implement a digital system divided into two physical rooms (Room A & Room B).
The system performs the following steps:

1.	Data Reading: The system collects data from sensors or connected components.
2.	Sending Data to the Cloud: After reading, the data is sent to a cloud platform for processing and visualization.
3.	Threshold Comparison: The system compares the collected values with predefined threshold values to determine the status.
4.	Data Display in the Cloud: The processed data is displayed on a cloud dashboard for monitoring system performance and readings.
5.	Decision Making: Based on the compared values and sensor inputs, the system decides whether to activate an action (e.g., turning on water) or perform other operations.
6.	
This design illustrates the interaction between physical components, the logical arrangement, and the simulation to show the expected system behavior before actual implementation.
Physical Setup
The system is physically separated into Room A and Room B.
