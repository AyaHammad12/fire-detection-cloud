# Digital System Project


## Description
This project aims to design and implement a digital system divided into **two physical rooms (Room A & Room B)**.  

The system performs the following steps:  

1. **Data Reading:** Collects data from sensors or connected components.  
2. **Sending Data to the Cloud:** Sends the collected data to a cloud platform for processing and visualization.  
3. **Threshold Comparison:** Compares the values with predefined thresholds to determine the status.  
4. **Data Display in the Cloud:** Displays the processed data on a cloud dashboard for monitoring system performance.  
5. **Decision Making:** Based on the values and sensor inputs, decides whether to activate an action (e.g., turning on water) or perform other operations.  

This design illustrates the interaction between physical components, the logical arrangement, and the simulation to show the expected system behavior before actual implementation.

## Physical Setup
The system is physically separated into Room A and Room B.
